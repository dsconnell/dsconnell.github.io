I'm an air pollution specialist at [California's Air Resources Board](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/topics/enforcement). In 2021 I graduated from UC Berkeley School of Public Health with a Masterâ€™s in global health and environment. In 2017 I got my environmental science BS with a software engineering minor from Rochester Institute of Technology.
